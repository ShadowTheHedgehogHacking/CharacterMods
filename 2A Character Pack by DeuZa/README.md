// How to install //

If you do not know how to install this mod, watch the tutorial made by dreamsyntax at 1:26.
This concerns its 2 player Mode, but the principle remains the same.

*** Attention ****
To avoid bugs you must replace the partner corresponding to the characters you play.
For example if you want to play Sonic, then Sonic, the partner in game, must become another character.
Otherwise there are chances that the game crashes in the goal ring, even in expert mode.
That is why in each character folder, the corresponding partner is replaced by shadow (Full Black Red).
For exemple, to play Sonic, go to the Player 1 character folder and go to Sonic. Inside, shadow.one is Sonic Player 1 and sonic.one is Shadow as Partner.


I - Playable character : Player 1

1 - 	Instead of the slide attack, all the characters curl up in a ball, as in a sonic classic game.

2 - 	The black color of shadow is now full black, and Its slow acceleration animation has been replaced by the fast one to give a better feeling of speed.

3 - 	Android shadows are versions without ammo at will.
	Their cannon arms just accommodate the weapons you pick up, as if you were playing with classic shadow.
	Their metallic textures of their bodies have been darkened a bit for more style.

II - Playable character : Player 2

The player 2 folder exists for version 2 player of shadow the hedgehog by dreamsyntax and for battle mode in normal game.

III - Partner :

*** For all partner switch, Use the version corresponding to Player 1's BON ***
In the partner folder, you will find versions of each partner in :

1 - 	Egg Pawn

2 - 	Egg Shadow Android

3 -	Red Shadow

4 -	Shadow Color (color according to the Jumpball of the basic partner)

5 -	Android Metal Shadow ((color according to the Jumpball of the basic partner)

6 - 	DoomEye may change with E-Shadow (if the player embodies shadow, E-Shadow will take his color)

7 -	You can also change change Sonic partner's Skin color, and Knuckles partner for its Mania color.

The reboot character folder is just used to replace the original characters of the game.
