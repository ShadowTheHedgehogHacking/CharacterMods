# CharacterMods
Collection of model replacements


Choose the .one you want from the corresponding folder


Place in files/character

Subfolders:


`Uses Default Shadow BON and MTP`


and


`Uses Custom BON and MTP`


This means currently both players must have matching BON/MTP without the additional memory used for individual BON/MTP.


A proof of concept was done to confirm its possible but I have not yet made a code to automatically handle this.


Plus having unique BON/MTP uses more of GLOBAL buffer and may lead to more frequent crashes.


Proof of concept here:

=======================================================
NULL.DFF can be used to replace other .DFFs in a .one if an import is an all-in-one DFF instead of separated.
