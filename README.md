Collection of model replacements


Choose the .one you want from the corresponding folder


Place in files/character

Subfolders:


`Default Shadow BON and MTP`


and


`Custom BON and MTP`


This means currently both players must have matching BON/MTP without the additional memory used for individual BON/MTP.


A proof of concept was done to confirm its possible but I have not yet made a code to automatically handle this.


Plus having unique BON/MTP uses more of GLOBAL buffer and may lead to more frequent crashes.


Proof of concept here:

=======================================================


NULL.DFF can be used to replace other .DFFs in a .one if an import is an all-in-one DFF instead of separated.


The 2A Character Pack by DeuZa may contain broken models/unplayable models, be sure to read the readme in the folder. The pack is a first attempt at using MTN Swapper tool to put all partners over shadow.
